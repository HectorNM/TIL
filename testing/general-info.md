# Types of tests

## Fuzz testing

Fuzzing or fuzz testing is a testing method that injects invalid, malformed, or unexpected inputs into a system to reveal software defects and vulnerabilities. 

These inputs are "valid enough" to be accepted as valid inputs, and generating them involes a lot of methods: by manually-entered iput, by modifying existing inputs, by giving to fuzzer information about the program structure, etc.
