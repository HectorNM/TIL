# TIL
Today I Learned: a project to concentrate at least one thing I learned each day.

Each folder will have informations for a domain of knowledge (e.g: `databases`).

Each folder will have files in two formats:
- `.md` files: non-structured plain text,
- `.txt` files: the same information in `.md` files, but rewritten in a question/answer (so I can create Anki cards later to memorize knowledge).
